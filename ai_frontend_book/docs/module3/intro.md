# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac™, which provides the AI "brain" for robotic systems. You'll learn about Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for perception and navigation, and Nav2 for path planning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim and its role in synthetic data generation
- Implement Isaac ROS for visual SLAM and navigation
- Use Nav2 for path planning and navigation
- Integrate AI perception systems with robot control
- Apply synthetic data techniques for training AI models

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:
1. [Isaac Sim](./isaac-sim) - Synthetic data and simulation environment
2. [Isaac ROS](./isaac-ros) - Perception and navigation with NVIDIA tools
3. [Nav2 Path Planning](./nav2-planning) - Navigation and path planning systems

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have completed Modules 1 and 2. Familiarity with:
- ROS 2 concepts and Python AI agents
- Simulation environments (Gazebo/Unity)
- Basic machine learning concepts

## Target Audience

AI and Robotics students who want to learn advanced AI-robot integration using professional-grade tools from NVIDIA for perception, navigation, and synthetic data generation.
