# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Overview

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This comprehensive course teaches learners to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern robotics platforms, with a focus on connecting AI systems to humanoid robots in simulated environments.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into four comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module1/intro)
- ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python AI agents with `rclpy`
- Humanoid URDF basics

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](./module2/intro)
- Physics and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity interaction in Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth, IMU)

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](./module3/intro)
- Isaac Sim and synthetic data
- Isaac ROS (VSLAM, navigation)
- Nav2 path planning

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./module4/intro)
- Voice commands with Whisper
- LLM-based task planning
- Capstone: Autonomous humanoid

## Target Audience

AI and Robotics students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand how to connect AI systems to humanoid robots in simulated environments.

## Learning Path

The modules are designed to be taken sequentially, with each building on the previous:

1. **Foundation** (Module 1): Core ROS 2 concepts and basic AI integration
2. **Simulation** (Module 2): Virtual environments for testing and validation
3. **Advanced Integration** (Module 3): Professional-grade AI-robot integration
4. **Capstone** (Module 4): Advanced AI control with autonomous humanoid implementation

Each module is self-contained and can be studied independently, though the sequential approach provides the best learning experience.
