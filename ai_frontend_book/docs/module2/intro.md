# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on creating and working with digital twins of humanoid robots using simulation environments. You'll learn about physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity interaction in Unity, as well as sensor simulation techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand physics simulation and collision handling in Gazebo
- Create high-fidelity interactions in Unity environments
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth, and IMU sensors
- Connect simulated sensors to AI algorithms
- Validate AI-robot systems in simulation before deployment

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:
1. [Gazebo Physics Simulation](./gazebo-physics) - Physics and collision handling
2. [Unity Interaction](./unity-interaction) - High-fidelity simulation environments
3. [Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation) - Simulated sensor data for AI systems

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have completed Module 1 and have a basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts. Familiarity with basic physics concepts is helpful but not required.

## Target Audience

AI and Robotics students who want to learn how to work with simulated environments to test and validate their AI-robot systems without requiring physical hardware.
