# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the core middleware connecting AI logic to humanoid robot control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in connecting AI logic to humanoid robot control
- Create Python ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
- Implement publishing, subscribing, and service calls
- Understand the flow from AI agent to robot controller
- Read and reason about humanoid URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:
1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals) - Core concepts and architecture
2. [Python AI Agents with ROS 2](./python-ai-agents) - Practical implementation with rclpy
3. [Humanoid Robot Structure (URDF)](./urdf-basics) - Robot description and structure

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have basic Python knowledge. No prior robotics experience is required, though it may be helpful.

## Target Audience

AI and Robotics students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand how to connect AI systems to humanoid robots using ROS 2 as the middleware.
